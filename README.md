# ICSharpCode.TextEditor
ICSharpCode.TextEditor for WinForms from SharpDevelop

This version of ICSharpCode.TextEditor fixes the issue that the scrollbars are always visible in the text editor. It does it by checking if vertical and horizontall scrollbars should be rendered and renders them only whenever needed.
